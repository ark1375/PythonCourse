## Installation of Python
Installing python is an easy job. Considering you have **windows** installed on your PC (or laptop) follow the steps:
1. Download the python interpreter from [the original website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\
&emsp; Use any version you like. Curently in Jan-2024, version 3.12.1 is available. Use it if you like.

2. Double click and install it. Remember to turn on the `add to path` option when installing.

3. In start menu, type `IDLE` and open the program. You are ready to go :relieved:.

## Running the Codes
In order to use the code, you need to either open it up in IDLE (and run it), or you need to run it using a terminal.  
#### IDLE
Download the code from github and put it somewhere suitable in your PC. Open the IDLE and from the top menu chose file, open, and navigate to the codes folder and open one. Then hit `F5` key or from the top menu, hit `Run` and then `Run Module`.

#### Terminal
This is a little more tricky but follow the steps and you will be fine. \
Considering that you installed python already, and again, taking that you have Windows 7 or higher, follow the steps:
1. Download the code from github and put it somewhere in your computer.
2. Open the code folder where the `.py` files are stored.
3. In the folder, hold the `shift` key and right click in the middle of the folder. __Don't right click on any file__.
4. In the opened menu, click `Open Powershell here`. A Powershell window will open with it's directory set to the current code folder.
5. In the powershell, type in the following command and your code will run. \
`python [name_of_the_code].py`. \
Replace the *name_of_the_code* with the name of the file that you want to run. For example: `python 1-helloworld.py`
